### Dear Reader, we are Team Gemera and we are happy to see you here!

This project is about web-site parcing related to the topic of Real Estates. Considering all related web-sites our team has chosen Krisha.kz as our first victim.

### Shortly about Krisha.kz

Krisha.kz is a specialized site about real estate in Kazakhstan. Here people who want to buy a roof (and with it walls, doors and windows) can meet with those who can offer all this to agree on mutually beneficial terms. In addition, on krisha.kz you can find a full range of construction, finishing, repair and other household services, contact specialists in housing law and insurance, find a good furniture store and learn about the latest news on the real estate market.
